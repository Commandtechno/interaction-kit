## Values

Since this is the top level of Interaction Kit, I'm going to start off by talking about my values and what my ideals for Interaction Kit are. When I'm working on this project, I usually start with thinking about how best to design a feature for use as opposed to implementation. To do this, I usually start with mocking out how a developer would use the feature and then work backwards to figure out how to implement it in a way that achieves that interface. There are various terms for this approach; it's sometimes referred to as [API driven development]().

When I'm thinking through how a developer will use a new feature, these are some of the pillars I try to evaluate:

- **Expressiveness**
- **Conciseness**
- **Clarity**
- **Simplicity**
