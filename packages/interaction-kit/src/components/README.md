# Components

I probably chose a poor name for this, but this directory holds compnents that get attached to messages or commands. I say the name is poor because it's easy to see the name and assume it holds Message Components - in actuality, message components are a subset of what is grouped here.

If you have a better idea for a name, let me know!
